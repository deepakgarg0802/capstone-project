# capstone-project
This is my final project for Udacity's Android Nanodegree program. Click [here] (https://goo.gl/photos/2ZLYdnHGgSFqptGD7) to see screenshots. The app has three screens, a combined map and list screen to view local events, a detail screen for viewing event details, and a filter screen to select criteria for narrowing results. Other features include a collection widget, intent service for networking, SQLite database, content provider, data loaders, and Google Location Services.


To use this app you will need two API keys. One from EventBrite, which can be requested [here] (http://www.eventbrite.com/myaccount/apps/) (you will need an EventBrite account) and one for the Google Maps API, which can be requested through the [Google Developer Console] (https://console.developers.google.com/) (you will also need a Google account).
